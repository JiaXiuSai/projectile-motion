# Projectile Motion Simulation
### Overview
This Python program uses the programming principles taught in the classroom and the labs to simulate a model of the Physics concept of projectile motion. It focuses on a sphere object that is fired out of an air cannon at different speeds. It will show the changing speed, acceleration and distance with both a spreadsheet and animated graphics from the variable parameters input by the user. This will study what effect the angle, initial speed and weight of the projectile will have on the variables using a set of equations. This is achieved by using the programming principles taught in the classroom and the labs to simulate a model of the Physics concept of projectile motion. This project was made for Durham University International Study Centre Foundation - Project for Science module.

### Installation
1. You will need to install one of the 3.x versions available at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download [**projectile_motion.py**](https://github.com/rpsh88/projectile-motion/blob/master/projectile_motion.py) and additional Python libraries:
* [graphics.py](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~rsarkis/csc161/python/pip-graphics.html)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html)
3. Run **projectile_motion.py** in terminal.
