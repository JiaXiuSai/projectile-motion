# Projectile Motion Simulation
### Overview
This project was made for Durham University International Study Centre Foundation Computer Science Project for Science module. The project uses the programming principles taught in the classroom and the labs to simulate a model of the Physics concept of projectile motion.

### Installation
1. You will need to install one of the 3.x versions available at python.org.
2. Download [projectile_motion.py](https://github.com/rpsh88/projectile-motion/blob/master/projectile_motion.py) and additional Python libraries:
* [graphics.py](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~rsarkis/csc161/python/pip-graphics.html)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html)
