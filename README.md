# Projectile Motion Simulation
### Overview
This Python program uses the programming principles taught in the classroom and the labs to simulate a model of the Physics concept of projectile motion. This project was made for Durham University International Study Centre Foundation Computer Science Project for Science module. 

### Installation
1. You will need to install one of the 3.x versions available at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download [**projectile_motion.py**](https://github.com/rpsh88/projectile-motion/blob/master/projectile_motion.py) and additional Python libraries:
* [graphics.py](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~rsarkis/csc161/python/pip-graphics.html)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html)
3. Run **projectile_motion.py** in terminal.
